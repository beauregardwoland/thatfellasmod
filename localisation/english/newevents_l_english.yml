 Moscow.d:0 "It has now been confirmed that Moscow, the capital of The Soviet Union, has been liberated from German occupation. Soviet forces have entered the city, and the remaining German garrison has surrendered. Russians could be seen cheering their liberators as they marched down the Red Square, even while there were rumors of German sniper fire in some parts of the city.\n\nIt was feared that the Germans would employ a strategy of scorched earth and leave the city a burning ruin, but the city's landmarks appear to have been spared. Indeed, the Soviet flag can even now be seen flying from the Kremlin."
